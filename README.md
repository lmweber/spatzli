[![R build status](https://github.com/lmweber/spatzli/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lmweber/spatzli/actions)


## Overview

R package containing functions for analyzing spatial transcriptomics data.

These functions are used in our online textbook [Orchestrating Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis with Bioconductor (OSTA)](https://github.com/lmweber/OSTA-base) and other work.

Currently focused on data from the [10x Genomics Visium](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/spatial-gene-expression) platform, but may be extended to other platforms in the future.


## Contents

Functions for:

- preprocessing visualizations (quality control, filtering)

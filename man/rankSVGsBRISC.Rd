\usage{
rankSVGsBRISC(
  spe,
  x = NULL,
  n.neighbors = 15,
  filter_counts = 5,
  filter_mito = TRUE,
  gene_name = "gene_name",
  n_threads = 4,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spe}{Input object (SpatialExperiment). Assumed to contain "logcounts"
assay and spatial coordinates.}

\item{x}{Matrix of covariates for "BRISC_estimation()". Number of rows must
equal number of spots. See "?BRISC_estimation" for details. Default = NULL
(intercept-only model).}

\item{n.neighbors}{Number of nearest neighbors for BRISC. Default = 15.}

\item{filter_counts}{Filter out zero-expressed and low-expressed genes by
keeping genes with at least this number of UMI counts in at least one spot.
Default = 5.}

\item{filter_mito}{Whether to filter out mitochondrial genes. (Mitochondrial
genes are very highly expressed and may rank highly as SVGs if included,
but are often not of primary biological interest.) Default = TRUE.}

\item{gene_name}{Column in "rowData" containing gene names if "filter_mito =
TRUE". Default = "gene_name".}

\item{n_threads}{Number of threads for parallelization. Default = 4.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass to "BRISC_estimation()".}
}
\value{
Returns summary statistics from BRISC as new columns in "rowData",
  which can be used to rank SVGs. Genes that were excluded due to filtering
  are given NA values.

Rank spatially variable genes (SVGs) using BRISC approach
}
\details{
Calculate ranking of spatially variable genes (SVGs) using the BRISC approach
(bootstrap for rapid inference on spatial covariances) developed by Saha and
Datta (2018).
